Motivation for this document
This is intended to be a hand guide for anyone working with me, but most importantly those that directly report to me. I wanted to give visibility into how I operate, think, and what motivates me - so we have the best chance of being successful while working together. Thus, ﻿am sharing with you my philosophy on leadership and how I hope to work with you all.
My role
Growth is super important to me and I believe in the DNA of most folks within engineering and technology. It's the thing that keeps us engaged and thriving. My goal is usually going to be to unblock you, help guide the team to best achieve its mission, and help folks grow by pushing and challenging them.

My primary goal as your manager is to serve and support you all including listening to your ideas and concerns, and advocating for you when necessary. I believe that by enabling each of you to do your best work and grow in your careers, we will achieve our collective goals. If this is a game of League, then my role is that of the tank/support to block for you and empower you by providing the assistance you need to thrive. ﻿To follow that metaphor, I will also try to keep the roadmap as clear as possible by lighting the path forward with wards. 
What do I value most?
First and foremost, I believe in transparency. I think it's important to be open and honest about what's happening within our team and to share information that impacts the work we're doing. I commit to keeping you all in the loop on any updates or changes, whether it's related to our projects, processes, or any other aspect of our work. Just like how code that is easy to read and understand is crucial to making our software better, transparency is crucial to building trust and enabling us to work effectively as a team.
﻿I also value feedback and input from my team. I want to hear your thoughts and ideas on how we can make our team and projects better. By working together, we can identify areas for improvement and make sure everyone feels like they have a stake in our team's success. As such, I commit to regularly soliciting feedback and taking it into account when making decisions.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
1:1s
I will schedule weekly 1:1's with each team member, and I fully encourage you to take the lead with these conversations and bring anything to the table you feel you want to chat about. In these feel free to bring me any challenges you are facing, things you are excited to tackle, and so on. Feel free ﻿to throw ﻿extra time on my calendar any time you want or need to chat. Alternatively, shoot me a DM, or let's have a slack huddle.
﻿
Personality Quirks [bug… or feature?]
I ﻿tend to be a pretty passionate person and while that can manifest as really energizing a project or idea, I realize it can be overwhelming. I promise that passion is always because I care. 
I ﻿can get distracted working on too many things. I ﻿see problems to solve and want to jump in to help, even if now isn't the right time. If you have ever walked by my desk and seen my personal ﻿Kanban﻿ board, this is something I use to actively work through this. Feel free to remind me about tasks or topics you find important.
﻿I am sure I ﻿missed a few things, so let me know if there is anything to add here. I am always open to feedback and suggestions on how I can improve as a teammate and leader.

Interests
Here are some things I care about. If you ever want to strike up a casual conversation and don’t know what to talk about, these are never bad starters. 
Video games: I have been a passionate gamer my whole life. From the first game, I played on ColecoVision as a kid, to jungling as an Elise main in League of Legends nowadays. Feel free to ask me about the time I spent coaching college esports or what I am playing now. 
Sports: Huge American football fan (NFL and college). I frequently research scores and statistics and listen to hours of podcasts a week to get a heads-up playing fantasy football. Possibly a huge reason why I am interested in what we work on here on the esports statistics side. 
I also enjoy playing competitive kickball, and weightlifting and recently got dragged into doing CrossFit by my wife.  
Dogs: I’ve got two Toy Poodles (Tibbers left, Goomba on the right).
