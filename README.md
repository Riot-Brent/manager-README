# Brent's README

## Motivation for this Document

This is intended to be a guide for anyone working with me, especially those who directly report to me. I want to share how I operate, think, and what motivates me—so we have the best chance of being successful together. This document outlines my philosophy on leadership and how I aim to work with you all.

## My Role

Growth is at the heart of my work, and I believe it’s central to the DNA of those in engineering and technology. My primary goals are:
- Unblocking you.
- Guiding the team to achieve its mission.
- Helping you grow by pushing and challenging you.

As your manager, I’m here to serve and support you, listen to your ideas and concerns, and advocate for you when necessary. If this were a game of League of Legends, I’d be the tank/support—blocking, empowering, and lighting the path forward with wards.

## What I Value Most

### Transparency
I believe in being open and honest about what’s happening within our team. Like readable code is to software, transparency is to trust and effective teamwork. I commit to:
- Keeping you informed about updates or changes.
- Sharing information that impacts our work.

### Feedback
Your input is vital. Together, we can:
- Identify areas for improvement.
- Ensure everyone has a stake in our team’s success.
I commit to regularly soliciting feedback and considering it when making decisions.

## 1:1s

I will schedule weekly 1:1s with each team member. These are your meetings—take the lead! Use this time to:
- Discuss challenges.
- Share exciting opportunities.
- Bring up anything else on your mind.

Need more time? Feel free to:
- Add extra time on my calendar.
- DM me.
- Start a Slack huddle.

## Personality Quirks (Bug... or Feature?)

- **Passion**: I’m a passionate person. While this can energize projects, I recognize it can sometimes be overwhelming. It’s because I care deeply.
- **Distraction**: I sometimes get distracted by trying to tackle too many things. I actively work on this using a personal Kanban board—feel free to nudge me about important tasks or topics.

This is a living document, so let me know if there’s anything to add!
